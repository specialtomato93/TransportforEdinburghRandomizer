# TransportforEdinburghRandomizer
A little random route selector if you have a young scot card, are standing in Edinburgh's New Town and have a free day.

This program includes all the TfE routes that run through the city centre. 
It will generate a random route and a random direction of travel.
Some routes only have one direction because they terminate in the city centre.
If you have a free day and are super bored, use this and get on a random bus I guess
